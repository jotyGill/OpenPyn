# openpyn
A python3 script to easily connect to and switch between, OpenVPN servers hosted by NordVPN. Quickly Connect to the least busy servers (using current data from Nordvpn's website) with lowest latency from you. Find servers in a specific country or even a city. It Tunnels DNS traffic through the VPN which normally (when using OpenVPN with NordVPN) goes through your ISP's DNS (still unencrypted, even if you use a thirdparty) and completely compromises Privacy!

## Features
* Automatically connect to least busy, low latency servers in a given country.
* Find and connect to servers in a specific city or state. (New!)
* Uses NordVPN's DNS servers and tunnels DNS queries through the VPN Tunnel.
* Use Iptable rules to prevent leakage if tunnel breaks (Experimental).
* Quickly Connect to any specific server. i.e au10 or us20.
* Downloads and Updates (modifications) the latest config files from NordVPN.
* Option to run the script in background (openvpn daemon mode).
* Options to finetune server selection based on "Server Load" or "Ping Latency".
* Excludes the servers that don't support OpenVPN (TCP or UDP depending upon which one you are trying to use).
* Finds and displays nord vpn servers (with extra info) in a given country.
* Now list and connect to servers with "Peer To Peer" --p2p, "Dedicated IP" --dedicated, "Tor Over VPN" --tor, \
"Double VPN" --double, "Anti DDos" --anti-ddos support.

## Instructions
1. Install dependencies if they are not already present.
``` bash
# dependencies
sudo apt install openvpn
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
2. Install openpyn with pip:
``` bash
sudo -H pip3 install openpyn
```
3. That's it, run the script! when done with it, press "Ctr + C" to exit.
  If credentials are not stored at '/usr/share/openpyn/credentials' (first run), Script will ask for them.


## Basic Usage
* At minimum, you only need to specifiy the countryCode, default port is TCP-443, If you want to use
UDP-1194 instead, use "-u" switch.
``` bash
openpyn us -u
```
* Now, you can also specifiy a city or state, usefull when companies (like Google) lock your
account if you login from a ip that resides in a different physical location.
``` bash
openpyn us -a ny
openpyn us -a "new york"
```
* To enforce Firewall rules to prevent dns leakage, also from ip leakage if tunnel breaks.
``` bash
openpyn us -f # (Highly Experimental!) Warning, clears IPtables rules!
              # (changes are non persistent, simply reboot if having networking issues)
```
* To quickly connect to a specific server.
``` bash
openpyn -s au10
```
* To list all the Countries and their Country Codes where NordVPN hosts servers.
``` bash
openpyn -l
```
* To find detailed information about the available servers in a given country.
``` bash
openpyn -l uk
```
* To find servers with featurs like "peer-to-peer", "dedicated ip", "tor over vpn",
  "double vpn" in all countries or a given country.
``` bash
openpyn -l uk --p2p
openpyn -l uk --dedicated
openpyn -l --tor  # tor over vpn in all countries
```
* To find the least loaded 10 NordVPN servers in US that support "peer-to-peer", out
  of them, connect to one of the top 2 servers that have the lowest latency from you.
``` bash
openpyn us -t 10 -T 2 --p2p
```
* To run the script in background.
``` bash
openpyn us -d
```
* To kill a running openvpn connection.
``` bash
sudo openpyn -k
```
* To Flush the iptables and kill any running openvpn connections.
``` bash
sudo openpyn -x
```
* To Download/Update the latest vpn config files from NordVPN by:
``` bash
openpyn --update
```
